# svg-logo-maker

## motivation

 My motivation to code out this project was simply to create a set a questions that ask you to describe a simple logo and for it to output said logo for you.

 ## problem-solved

  Not really sure it solves a problem but it does give one a small help in creating a simple placeholder logo or even if they like it enough a logo.

## lesson
 
 Learned a good deal of things and the complexity of working with Object Oriented Programming(OOP). Also the benefit and headache of working with jest to test if the code will come out the way it is programmed to. That in itself to quite a bit of work to get running and to debug so that it would run properly.
